# Landing Page Project

Base code was copied from [Udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019) 

All the javascript is wrote by the developer, and it is being used to add and modify elements on the main page.

Simple Website with code separate in Sections

The following dynamic behaviour was added with Vanilla JS:
* Dynamic Navigation Menu;
* Highlighting active sections;
* Disappearing Navigation Menu if user is not scrolling;
