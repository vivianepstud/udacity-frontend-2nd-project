# Landing Page Project

Base HTML and CSS copied from [Udacity Landing Page repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019). 

All the javascript is wrote by the developer, and it is being used to add and modify elements on the main page.

Simple Website with content separated into sections.

The following dynamic behaviour was added with Vanilla JS:
* Dynamic Navigation Menu;
* Highlighting active sections;
* Disappearing Navigation Menu if user is not scrolling;
